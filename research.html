   <h1>Research</h1>
   <p style="font-size:100%">Most of my research concerns the semantics and pragmatics of tense and aspect, although I am also interested in many other topics involving formal semantics. My current projects are: </p>
   <p><b>Solving the Present Perfect Puzzle (Klein 1992)</b></p>
   <p>The Present Perfect Puzzle refers to the fact that in English (and some other languages), the present perfect cannot be used with a past temporal adverbial (e.g. <i>#Mary has watched the football game yesterday</i>), despite the fact that the event time does fall into the past time denoted by the adverbial. In addition, languages with the present perfect differ in whether they have this constraint. My analysis: in languages that have the Present Perfect Puzzle effect (English, some variaties of Spanish, and several Romance languages in Italy), when topic time of the sentence is a contextually salient past time, the present perfect has a presuppositionally stronger alternative, the simple past, which presupposes a familiar past topic time. By Maximize Presupposition (Heim 1991, a.o.), the simple past must be preferred. In languages that do not have the Present Perfect Puzzle, this presuppositionally stronger alternative is absent or unavailable due to register reasons. This analysis has the advantage of not relying on semantic contradiction (as some previous analyses do), and makes a much better prediction of the crosslinguistic variation.</p>


   <p><b>The crosslinguistic variation in tense and aspect systems</b></p>
   <p>I am also collecting data on the variation of tenses and aspect in languages. These include: the anaphoric potential of tenses and aspects, the discourse relations they establish with other times/events in the context (cf. Kamp et at. 2011; Altshuler 2012, a.o.), their presuppositions, the set of alternatives available, the crosslinguistic variation of the present perfect.</p>
   <p><b>Temporal interpretation of Mandarin Chinese and the division of labour between tense and aspect</b></p>
   <p>The tenseless analysis of Mandarin Chinese (Klein et al. 2000; Lin 2006, 2007, 2010) argue that the temporal interpretation of Mandarin Chinese comes from the context and the help of past-shifting aspect particles (e.g. the perfective <i>-le</i>). The tense analysis of Mandarin Chinese include Sybesma (2007), which argues that tense is an agreement particle and languages differ in whether it is morphologically explicit. Recent analyses such as Sun (2014) argue for a covert non-future tense along the lines of Matthewson (2006). Sun's account is based on the assumed different semantic types of stative (i,t) and non-statives(v,t) (Katz 1995, a.o.). Since statives can directly take a temporal argument, it does not need aspect marking for the past episodic reading. On the other hand, Sun claims that non-statives always need explicit aspect marking for the past episodic reading, since it cannot directly take the temporal argument. Sun concludes that this contrast shows that there must be a temporal argument, given by tense, in the structure.</p>
   <p>However, closer examination shows that non-statives in Mandarin Chinese do not always need aspectual marking (such as the perfective markers <i>-le</i> and <i>-guo</i>) to get the past episodic reading. This includes: direct quotational use of attitude verbs and a construction known as the resultative verb compounds (RVCs). My analysis is that Mandarin Chinese distinguishes the kind of relations an event establishes with other events in the context. In particular, the perfective <i>-le</i> presupposes either the identity or part-whole relations. RVCs and direct quotations presuppose the sequential relation, and the perfective <i>-guo</i> does not presuppose anything. These alternatives and a theory of competition together make a better prediction of the use of aspect marking in narration. While this analysis leaves open whether there needs to be tense in the language, it highlights a crosslinguistic variation in the division of labour between tenses and aspects in natural language. Since there is robust evidence for the non-future vs. future split in languages (Matthewson 2006 a.o.), I conclude that Mandarin Chinese has a null non-future tense, but different kinds of aspectual constructions also play an important role.</p>


   <p><b>Interactions between negation and aspects in Mandarin Chinese</b></p>
   <p>In Mandarin Chinese, the perfective marker <i>-le</i> cannot be used with the negation marker <i>mei</i>, while the other perfective marker <i>-guo</i>, can. This fact directly follows from my analysis of <i>-le</i> and <i>-guo</i>: <i>-le</i> presupposes that the event it marks must be in an identity or part-whole relation with an event in the context, hence it must exist. It follows that whenever <i>-le</i> is defined, the sentence negated by <i>mei</i> (denies the existence of the event) is false, resulting in L-analyticity at LF (Gajewski 2002, 2009; Theiler et al. 2017). In contrast, <i>-guo</i> does not have this problem since it does not presuppose anything.</p>
  <p>There are several previous accounts for this puzzle. Cheng and Li (1991) argue that the incompatibility between negation and <i>-le</i> results from the blocking of head lowering of Asp to V by the intruding Neg head (Cheng and Li 1991, Tang 1990), followed from the Head Movement Constraint (Travis 1984, Chomsky 1986, 1991). Ernst (1995) argues against this approach, citing theoretical issues with head lowering, as well as the failure of explaining the contrast between <i>-le</i> and <i>-guo</i>. Ernst argues that aspect particles are base-generated at VP and raised to Asp at LF, and that <i>mei</i> is a negative prefix. However, this still leaves open why <i>-le</i> and <i>-guo</i> behave differently. Xiang (2014) also takes a syntactic approach: she argues that <i>-le</i> and <i>-guo</i> have different syntactic positions, and that in order to realize the linear order of [V-Asp] and to check off aspect features, aspectual markers hop to verb stems under adjacency. Since <i>-guo</i> is located in a lower position, it can freely cooccur with <i>mei</i>, whereas <i>-le</i> and <i>mei</i> share the same Asp head, hence cannot co-occur. While there are some debates in the literature on the aspectual hierarchy in Mandarin Chinese, it is not clear why <i>mei</i> must share an Asp head with <i>-le</i>. </p>


   <p><b>Temporal Adjunct Clauses (Joint work with <a href=https://sites.google.com/view/gregorwilliamson/home>Greg Wiliamson)</a></b></p>
   <p>Stative predicates are not universally acceptable in Temporal Adverbial Clauses (TACs) headed by <i>before</i> and <i>after</i>, although <i>when</i> clauses do not appear to display any difficulty in embedding statives cross-linguistically. Typologically, there appear to be three types of language (Rett 2017): I. statives are allowed in both <i>before-</i> and <i>after-</i> clauses; II. statives are allowed in <i>before-</i> clauses only; III. statives are allowed in neither <i>before-</i> or <i>after-</i>, unless with overt inchoative markers, which turns the stative into an eventive.</p>

    <p>This project aims to explain the stative vs. eventive asymmetry in type II vs. type III asymmetry, and to explain the <i>before-</i> and <i>after-</i> asymmetry in type II languages. We argue that:</p>
    <p>- Languages differ with respect to whether they have a prepositional or quantificational <i>before</i>.</p>
    <p>- <i>After</i> is always prepositional.</p>
    <p>- Prepositional <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> require temporal clauses to be type shifted.</p>
    <p>- Stative temporal clauses cannot be type shifted.</p>
    <p>- The apparent embedding of statives in <i>after</i>-clauses in Type I languages is due to the presence of a covert inchoative marker.</p>
    <p>- Mandarin Chinese is type II instead of type I as in Rett (2017).</p>
