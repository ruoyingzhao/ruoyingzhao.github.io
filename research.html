   <p style="font-size:100%">Most of my research concerns the semantics and pragmatics of tense and aspect, although I am also interested in many other topics involving formal semantics. You can check out some of my projects below!</p>

   <div  class="collapsible"><b>Solving the Present Perfect Puzzle (Klein 1992)</b></div>
   <div class="content">
     <p>The Present Perfect Puzzle refers to the fact that in English (and some other languages), the present perfect cannot be used with a past temporal adverbial (e.g. <i>#Mary has watched the football game yesterday</i>), despite the fact that the event time does fall into the past time denoted by the adverbial. In addition, languages with the present perfect differ in whether they have this constraint. </p>

     <p> My analysis: the present perfect has the weaker version of Extended Now semantics (Gronn and von Stechow 2017), which allows the reference time of a present perfect sentence to be either an Extended Now interval that includes the speech time, or a past interval. In principle, the present perfect should be compatible with the reference time being a past interval provided by the adverbial. However, in languages that have the Present Perfect Puzzle effect (English, some variaties of Spanish, and several Romance languages in Italy), the anaphoric past tense is a presuppositionally stronger alternative to the present perfect. By Presupposed Ignorance Principle (Spector and Sudo 2017), the past tense must be preferred over the present perfect.</p>

     <p>On the other hand, in languages that do not have the Present Perfect Puzzle (the spoken version of the standard variety of French, German and Italian), the anaphoric simple past (anaphoric past tense + perfective aspect, which competes with the perfective present perfect in these languages) is absent, allowing the present perfect to take over.</p>

    <p>This analysis has the advantage of not relying on semantic contradiction (as some previous analyses do), and makes a much better prediction of the crosslinguistic variation given the distribution of the alternatives for the past reading. </p>

   <p><b>Temporal interpretation of Mandarin Chinese and the division of labour between tense and aspect</b></p>
   <p>The tenseless analyses of Mandarin Chinese (Klein et al. 2000; Lin 2006, 2007, 2010) argue that the temporal interpretation of Mandarin Chinese comes from the context and the help of past-shifting aspect particles (e.g. the perfective <i>-le</i>). The tensed analyses of Mandarin Chinese include Sybesma (2007), which argues that tense is an agreement particle and languages differ in whether it is morphologically explicit. Recent analyses such as Sun (2014) argue for a covert non-future tense along the lines of Matthewson (2006).</p>
   <p>There is no consensus in the literature on the status of the rich collection of aspect markers in Mandarin Chinese, especially the perfective markers. There is also a lot of disagreement in the judgements, possibly due to misclassification of the often homophonous particles. I argue that Mandarin Chinese has three particles with the standard perfective semantics (&exist; e [&tau;(e)&sube; t]): (i) the perfective sentence-final <i>-le</i>; (ii) the verbal <i>-le</i>; (iii) <i>-guo</i>. The perfective sentence-final <i>-le</i> is presupposition-less; the verbal <i>-le</i> is an anaphoric particle, presupposing an event antecedent via a relation; <i>-guo</i> presupposes non-resultativeness (that there does not exist a result state of the <i>-guo</i>-marked event that answers the topic question, cf. Portner (2003)). </p>

  <p><b>The crosslinguistic variation in tense-aspectual constructions and perfect-like readings</b></p>
   <p> The previous literature established the set of ‘perfect’ readings, including experiential/existential, resultative, recent past, hot news, the Present Perfect Puzzle, the lifetime effect, and the lack of narrative progression (McCawley 1971; McCoard 1978; Portner 2011, a.o.). On the other hand, it has been noted that the present perfect in some languages other than English, as well as similar tense/aspect constructions in other languages, falls into the category of a ‘general purpose past perfective’ (Bertrand et al. 2022), sharing some properties with the English present perfect while not being subject to constraints such as the lifetime effect and the Present Perfect Puzzle. </p>

   <p>I propose that the general-purpose past perfectives are presuppositionally neutral tense/aspect constructions that allow the standard past perfective reading. If a language has presuppositionally stronger alternatives for the past perfective (anaphoricity, uniqueness, etc.), by the Presupposed Ignorance Principle (PIP), the standard, pre-suppositionally neutral, past perfective will be felicitous only if the pre-suppositionally stronger alternatives cannot be used. I argue that this competition is the source of many of the perfect readings observed. I further argue that the cross-linguistic variation in this respect follows from the available alternatives languages have. I illustrate this idea with three groups of languages: (i) English; (ii) French, German, Italian; and (iii) Mandarin Chinese, each illustrating a different set of alternatives available. This analysis allows me to decompose various perfect readings that come from different sources and make better predictions regarding which of these readings a tense/aspect construction in a given language has. The alternatives examined are summarized in the table below.

  <!-- <p><b>Interactions between negation and aspects in Mandarin Chinese</b></p> -->
  <!-- <p>In Mandarin Chinese, the perfective marker <i>-le</i> cannot be used with the negation marker <i>mei</i>, while the other perfective marker <i>-guo</i>, can. This fact directly follows from my analysis of <i>-le</i> and <i>-guo</i>: <i>-le</i> presupposes that the event it marks must be in an identity or part-whole relation with an event in the context, hence it must exist. It follows that whenever <i>-le</i> is defined, the sentence negated by <i>mei</i> (denies the existence of the event) is false, resulting in L-analyticity at LF (Gajewski 2002, 2009; Theiler et al. 2017). In contrast, <i>-guo</i> does not have this problem since it does not presuppose anything.</p> -->

  <!-- <p>There are several previous accounts for this puzzle. Cheng and Li (1991) argue that the incompatibility between negation and <i>-le</i> results from the blocking of head lowering of Asp to V by the intruding Neg head (Cheng and Li 1991, Tang 1990), followed from the Head Movement Constraint (Travis 1984, Chomsky 1986, 1991). Ernst (1995) argues against this approach, citing theoretical issues with head lowering, as well as the failure of explaining the contrast between <i>-le</i> and <i>-guo</i>. Ernst argues that aspect particles are base-generated at VP and raised to Asp at LF, and that <i>mei</i> is a negative prefix. However, this still leaves open why <i>-le</i> and <i>-guo</i> behave differently. Xiang (2014) also takes a syntactic approach: she argues that <i>-le</i> and <i>-guo</i> have different syntactic positions, and that in order to realize the linear order of [V-Asp] and to check off aspect features, aspectual markers hop to verb stems under adjacency. Since <i>-guo</i> is located in a lower position, it can freely cooccur with <i>mei</i>, whereas <i>-le</i> and <i>mei</i> share the same Asp head, hence cannot co-occur. While there are some debates in the literature on the aspectual hierarchy in Mandarin Chinese, it is not clear why <i>mei</i> must share an Asp head with <i>-le</i>. </p>  -->

   <p><b>Unique definites and anaphoric definites in dynamic semantics</b></p>

  <!-- <p>The concept of definiteness has two kind of analyses: familiarity and uniqueness. Historically, there is a split in the formalization of definites, depending on which of the two analyses is assumed. The familiarity analyses, such as Heim (1982), Kamp (1981), Kamp et al. (2011),  rely on dynamic binding of the index/discourse referents for anaphora purposes. Definites and indefinites has also been analyzed as alternatives with different presuppositions (Heim 1991, 2011), with their distribution explained with Maximize Presupposition. The uniqueness analyses, on the other hand, mostly use situation semantics for the purpose of domain restriction, such as Heim (1990) and Elbourne (2013). However, recent literature has established that familiarity and uniqueness are not different <i>analyses</i> of definiteness, but rather different sub-concepts of it, and many languages may use different morphology for the two readings (Schwarz 2009, 2013; Jenks 2015,2018; Bombi 2018, a.o.). These recent accounts treat anaphoric definites as having an additional index argument on top of a unique definite, which can be dynamically bound for the various anaphoric readings. Unique definites, on the other hand, have a situation argument for domain restriction. While theses accounts are successful in capturing the crosslinguistic data, they are relatively vague about how indefinites are treated: due to the historical reasons mentioned above, the two types of definiteness have different formal systems, which treat indefinites radically differently. The uniqueness analyses of definites treat indefinites as generalized existential quantifiers, and anaphoric analyses of definites such as dynamic semantics and DRT, treat both definites and indefinites as variables.  We find ourselves in a dilemma: there is a need to accommodate the recent developments in the field regarding the crosslingusitic data and the variation in definiteness, but the existing formal systems cannot incorporate anaphoric definites, unique definites, and indefinites all at the same time. </p> -->
  <!-- <p>I propose a way of integrating unique definites into dynamic semantics by including situations. This system is based on the previous proposal of Sudo (2017) for an independent purpose. I show that in this system, we can both account for the crosslinguistic data, domain restriction of unique definites, discourse referents and anaphora, as well as the competition between definites and indefinites with Maximize Presupposition.</p> -->

   <p><b>Temporal Adjunct Clauses (Joint work with <a href=https://sites.google.com/view/gregorwilliamson/home>Greg Wiliamson)</a></b></p>
   <p>Stative predicates are not universally acceptable in Temporal Adverbial Clauses (TACs) headed by <i>before</i> and <i>after</i>, although <i>when</i> clauses do not appear to display any difficulty in embedding statives cross-linguistically. Typologically, there appear to be three types of language (Rett 2017): I. statives are allowed in both <i>before-</i> and <i>after-</i> clauses; II. statives are allowed in <i>before-</i> clauses only; III. statives are allowed in neither <i>before-</i> or <i>after-</i>, unless with overt inchoative markers, which turns the stative into an eventive.</p>

    <p>This project aims to explain the stative vs. eventive asymmetry in type II vs. type III asymmetry, and to explain the <i>before-</i> and <i>after-</i> asymmetry in type II languages. We argue that:</p>
    <p>- Languages differ with respect to whether they have a prepositional or quantificational <i>before</i>.</p>
    <p>- <i>After</i> is always prepositional.</p>
    <p>- Prepositional <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> require temporal clauses to be type shifted.</p>
    <p>- Stative temporal clauses cannot be type shifted.</p>
    <p>- The apparent embedding of statives in <i>after</i>-clauses in Type I languages is due to the presence of a covert inchoative marker.</p>
    <p>- Mandarin Chinese is type II instead of type I as in Rett (2017).</p>
