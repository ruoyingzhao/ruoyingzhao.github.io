   <h1>Research</h1>
   <p style="font-size:100%">Most of my research concerns the semantics and pragmatics of tense and aspect, although I am also interested in many other topics involving formal semantics. My current projects are: </p>
   <p><b>Solving the Present Perfect Puzzle (Klein 1992)</b></p>
   <p>The Present Perfect Puzzle refers to the fact that in English (and some other languages), the present perfect cannot be used with a past temporal adverbial (e.g. <i>#Mary has watched the football game yesterday</i>), despite the fact that the event time does fall into the past time denoted by the adverbial. In addition, languages with the present perfect differ in whether they have this constraint. My analysis: in languages that have the Present Perfect Puzzle effect (English, some variaties of Spanish, and several Romance languages in Italy), when topic time of the sentence is a contextually salient past time, the present perfect has a presuppositionally stronger alternative, the simple past, which presupposes a familiar past topic time. By Maximize Presupposition (Heim 1991, a.o.), the simple past must be preferred. In languages that do not have the Present Perfect Puzzle, this presuppositionally stronger alternative is absent or unavailable due to register reasons. This analysis has the advantage of not relying on semantic contradiction (as some previous analyses do), and makes a much better prediction of the crosslinguistic variation.</p>


   <p><b>The crosslinguistic variation in tense and aspect systems</b></p>
   <p>I am also collecting data on the variation of tenses and aspect in languages. These include: the anaphoric potential of tenses and aspects, the discourse relations they establish with other times/events in the context (cf. Kamp et at. 2011; Altshuler 2012, a.o.), their presuppositions, the set of alternatives available, the crosslinguistic variation of the present perfect.</p>

   <p><b>Temporal interpretation of Mandarin Chinese and the division of labour between tense and aspect</b></p>
   <p>The tenseless analyses of Mandarin Chinese (Klein et al. 2000; Lin 2006, 2007, 2010) argue that the temporal interpretation of Mandarin Chinese comes from the context and the help of past-shifting aspect particles (e.g. the perfective <i>-le</i>). The tensed analyses of Mandarin Chinese include Sybesma (2007), which argues that tense is an agreement particle and languages differ in whether it is morphologically explicit. Recent analyses such as Sun (2014) argue for a covert non-future tense along the lines of Matthewson (2006). Sun's account is based on the assumed different semantic types of stative (i,t) and non-statives(v,t) (Katz 1995, a.o.). Since statives can directly take a temporal argument, they do not need aspect marking for the past episodic reading. On the other hand, Sun claims that non-statives always need explicit aspect marking for the past episodic reading, since it cannot directly take the temporal argument. Sun concludes that this contrast shows that there must be a temporal argument, given by tense, in the structure. I conclude that Sun (2014) makes better empirical and theoretical predictions than previous accounts on Mandarin Chinese, and that she is right in proposing the nonfuture tense in the language.</p>
   <p>However, most previous accounts of Mandarin Chinese rely on putting some kind of past tense semantics in the aspectual markers such as the perfective <i>-le</i> and <i>-guo</i>, including Sun (2014). I argue, however, that <i>-le</i> and <i>-guo</i> have standard perfective semantics, and their distribution and various inference are results of their different presuppositions. My analysis is that Mandarin Chinese distinguishes the kind of relations an event establishes with other events in the context. In particular, the perfective <i>-le</i> presupposes either the identity or part-whole relations. In contrast, the perfective <i>-guo</i> does not presuppose anything. Together with Maximize Presupposition, this analysis makes better empirical prediction than previous analysis of Chinese aspects, and I also present novel data that cannot be covered by previous accounts. </p>
   <p>Importantly, the relationship between <i>-le</i> and <i>-guo</i>, while quite similar to the English anaphoric past and the present perfect in some of the inferences and distribution, cannot be reduced to the discourse status of the reference time. This observation suggests that languages may distinguish time-only anaphora and event-only anaphora. It also sheds light on the division of labour between times and events, tense and aspects in establishing discourse relations in narration.</p>
   <p>From a crosslinguistic perspective, I also show that the discontinuous inference of <i>-guo</i> differ from similar inferences associated with the discontinuous past tense and optional past tense in languages such as Washo (Bochnak 2016) and Tlingit (Cable 2017), as well as the existential past in languages like Atayal (Chen 2018).</p>


   <p><b>Interactions between negation and aspects in Mandarin Chinese</b></p>
   <p>In Mandarin Chinese, the perfective marker <i>-le</i> cannot be used with the negation marker <i>mei</i>, while the other perfective marker <i>-guo</i>, can. This fact directly follows from my analysis of <i>-le</i> and <i>-guo</i>: <i>-le</i> presupposes that the event it marks must be in an identity or part-whole relation with an event in the context, hence it must exist. It follows that whenever <i>-le</i> is defined, the sentence negated by <i>mei</i> (denies the existence of the event) is false, resulting in L-analyticity at LF (Gajewski 2002, 2009; Theiler et al. 2017). In contrast, <i>-guo</i> does not have this problem since it does not presuppose anything.</p>
  <p>There are several previous accounts for this puzzle. Cheng and Li (1991) argue that the incompatibility between negation and <i>-le</i> results from the blocking of head lowering of Asp to V by the intruding Neg head (Cheng and Li 1991, Tang 1990), followed from the Head Movement Constraint (Travis 1984, Chomsky 1986, 1991). Ernst (1995) argues against this approach, citing theoretical issues with head lowering, as well as the failure of explaining the contrast between <i>-le</i> and <i>-guo</i>. Ernst argues that aspect particles are base-generated at VP and raised to Asp at LF, and that <i>mei</i> is a negative prefix. However, this still leaves open why <i>-le</i> and <i>-guo</i> behave differently. Xiang (2014) also takes a syntactic approach: she argues that <i>-le</i> and <i>-guo</i> have different syntactic positions, and that in order to realize the linear order of [V-Asp] and to check off aspect features, aspectual markers hop to verb stems under adjacency. Since <i>-guo</i> is located in a lower position, it can freely cooccur with <i>mei</i>, whereas <i>-le</i> and <i>mei</i> share the same Asp head, hence cannot co-occur. While there are some debates in the literature on the aspectual hierarchy in Mandarin Chinese, it is not clear why <i>mei</i> must share an Asp head with <i>-le</i>. </p>

  <p><b>Unique definites and anaphoric definites in dynamic semantics</b></p>
  <p>The concept of definiteness has two kind of analyses: familiarity and uniqueness. Historically, there is a split in the formalization of definites, depending on which of the two analyses is assumed. The familiarity analyses, such as Heim (1982), Kamp (1981), Kamp et al. (2011),  rely on dynamic binding of the index/discourse referents for anaphora purposes. Definites and indefinites has also been analyzed as alternatives with different presuppositions (Heim 1991, 2011), with their distribution explained with Maximize Presupposition. The uniqueness analyses, on the other hand, mostly use situation semantics for the purpose of domain restriction, such as Heim (1990) and Elbourne (2013). However, recent literature has established that familiarity and uniqueness are not different <i>analyses</i> of definiteness, but rather different sub-concepts of it, and many languages may use different morphology for the two readings (Schwarz 2009, 2013; Jenks 2015,2018; Bombi 2018, a.o.). These recent accounts treat anaphoric definites as having an additional index argument on top of a unique definite, which can be dynamically bound for the various anaphoric readings. Unique definites, on the other hand, have a situation argument for domain restriction. While theses accounts are successful in capturing the crosslinguistic data, they are relatively vague about how indefinites are treated: due to the historical reasons mentioned above, the two types of definiteness have different formal systems, which treat indefinites radically differently. The uniqueness analyses of definites treat indefinites as generalized existential quantifiers, and anaphoric analyses of definites such as dynamic semantics and DRT, treat both definites and indefinites as variables.  We find ourselves in a dilemma: there is a need to accommodate the recent developments in the field regarding the crosslingusitic data and the variation in definiteness, but the existing formal systems cannot incorporate anaphoric definites, unique definites, and indefinites all at the same time. </p>
  <p>I propose a way of integrating unique definites into dynamic semantics by including situations. This system is based on the previous proposal of Sudo (2017) for an independent purpose. I show that in this system, we can both account for the crosslinguistic data, domain restriction of unique definites, discourse referents and anaphora, as well as the competition between definites and indefinites with Maximize Presupposition.</p>

   <p><b>Temporal Adjunct Clauses (Joint work with <a href=https://sites.google.com/view/gregorwilliamson/home>Greg Wiliamson)</a></b></p>
   <p>Stative predicates are not universally acceptable in Temporal Adverbial Clauses (TACs) headed by <i>before</i> and <i>after</i>, although <i>when</i> clauses do not appear to display any difficulty in embedding statives cross-linguistically. Typologically, there appear to be three types of language (Rett 2017): I. statives are allowed in both <i>before-</i> and <i>after-</i> clauses; II. statives are allowed in <i>before-</i> clauses only; III. statives are allowed in neither <i>before-</i> or <i>after-</i>, unless with overt inchoative markers, which turns the stative into an eventive.</p>

    <p>This project aims to explain the stative vs. eventive asymmetry in type II vs. type III asymmetry, and to explain the <i>before-</i> and <i>after-</i> asymmetry in type II languages. We argue that:</p>
    <p>- Languages differ with respect to whether they have a prepositional or quantificational <i>before</i>.</p>
    <p>- <i>After</i> is always prepositional.</p>
    <p>- Prepositional <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> require temporal clauses to be type shifted.</p>
    <p>- Stative temporal clauses cannot be type shifted.</p>
    <p>- The apparent embedding of statives in <i>after</i>-clauses in Type I languages is due to the presence of a covert inchoative marker.</p>
    <p>- Mandarin Chinese is type II instead of type I as in Rett (2017).</p>
